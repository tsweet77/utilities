Intention Color converts an intention into a color.

Sigil Generator creates a sigil from an intention.

sha256 Gives the SHA-256 hash of a file. Usage: sha256.exe "filename".

Multi-Hash utility lets you hash a text intention repeatedly (includes files) a certain number of times, making it more powerful.

Multi-Hash_OpenSSL is like Multi-Hash but uses OpenSSL and is at least 4X faster in hashing. It is tricky to compile though.
